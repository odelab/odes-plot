A. False positives are genes which are actually noncoding ORFs but are predicted as real genes. If we want to minimize the number of false positives, we need to find a threshold such that the ORFs that are higher than that threshold are mainly real genes. Among the three choices, 550 is the best one to satisfy this condition.

True positives are genes which are real genes and are predicted as real genes. If we want to maximize this number, we need to pick a threshold such that the ORFs that are higher than that threshold contain the most real genes. Among the three choices, 250 is the best option.

A. 

The template (from 3' to 5')is the following:

3' - ACGTTGCACGTTCAGTCACGTGGACCGTACCCG - 5'

The corresponding reverse complement (from 5' to 3' )is :

5' - TGCAACGTGCAAGTCAGTGCACCTGGCATGGGC - 3'

The primer is:

5’ - TGCAACGTGCAAGTCAGTGC - 3’

The primer will grow from 5' to 3' by the reverse complement sequence.

Since only dATP, dCTP, dGTP and ddTTP are provided, the single stranded product molecule will end after it incoporates a ddTTP as dTTP.

So the resulting product molecule will be: 5' - TGCAACGTGCAAGTCAGTGCACC(T) - 3', which has a length of 24.

B.
Since all four deoxy-nucleoside triphosphates are provided, the resulting product molecule will be the entire reverse complement sequence:

5' - TGCAACGTGCAAGTCAGTGCACCTGGCATGGGC - 3', which has a length of 33.

C. 
Since all four deoxy-nucleoside triphosphates and ddTTP are provided with equal concentrations, the resulting molecules will be:

5' - TGCAACGTGCAAGTCAGTGCACC(T) - 3', which has a length of 24

5' - TGCAACGTGCAAGTCAGTGCACCTGGCA(T) - 3', which has a length of 29

5' - TGCAACGTGCAAGTCAGTGCACCTGGCATGGGC - 3', which has a length of 33.

(3)
A. Yes. In both strands, from 5' to 3' direction, there is no stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA).  
B. No. In the top strand, there exists a stop codon TGA from 5' to 3'.
C. No. In the top strand, there exists a stop codon TGA from 5' to 3'. Although there exists a start codon ATG in the bottom strand, it can code for methionine in the middle of a gene.

(4)
The first primer is: 5' - GTCATTCTGA - 3'
The second primer is: 5' - CATGAGTATA - 3'
