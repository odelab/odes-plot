## Open Dynamic Engineering and Scientific Plotting Project @ Harvey Mudd College

This project aims to develop an online publishing platform that enables scientists and engineers to submit paper, data and graph codes, and dynamically interact with plots.

This project is currently in a very preliminary phase. We intend to use d3.js as the front end for data visualization. We would like to add support for multiple languages in the future, possibly through a kind of intermediate data objects.
